## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
We'll need to start with a sample Snakefile. I think the assembly one from the main
course seems reasonable.

Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop

## Software Setup

### Details

You will need the Snakemake software installed and working. One way to do this is to follow
the same setup instructions as for the [Snakemake for Bioinformatics lesson](
https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics/#software-installation).
