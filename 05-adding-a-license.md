::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the difference between license and copyright
- Understand what might inform, or limit, our choice of license
- Add a license to our own code

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What OSI licenses are available?
- How do I record ownership and authorship of my code?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Explain the difference between licence and copyright.

Explain the difference between legal restrictions and requests. Ie. "please cite" vs.
"you must cite", and why this is problematic for sharing services.

Chosing a license:

 - Is it compatible with the tools you are using?
 - Is it suitable for your users?
 - Is it acceptable to your employer?

# A citation file

Here we can explain the citation .cff and how to make it, and how to validate it.

Apparently the .cff file is parsed by WFH and translated to the format needed for RO-Crate,
so that's good.
