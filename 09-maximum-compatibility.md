::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Add resources to our rules
- Something something containers?
- ???

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- TODO

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


This is currently a placeholder for several things.

1) Resources. Setting them and adding them. That could be most of this episode. Maybe an episode
in itself?

2) Making your workflow run on Mac/Linux/x86/arm. Do we even care?

3) Container and Conda deployments.

Conda is already covered in the main tutorial but there is a bit more to say.
Containers are a whole new topic.

## Callout - HPC systems and cloud compatibility

Also, what about running on an HPC system? Do I want to go into any details about the profile setup
for that? Maybe just link to the docs as a callout.

That's probably it. Plenty to be getting on with.
