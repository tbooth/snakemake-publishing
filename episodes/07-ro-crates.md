This is where I give a general intro to RO-Crates.

What do they do, in general.

What do they do, for you.

What do you actually need to know:

1) If you are just looking to share your workflow, WFH will deal with the RO-Crate stuff for you

2) If you need to make an RO-Crate yourself, you can ? use the plugin ???

3) And then?
