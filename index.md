A supplementary lesson for users of the [Snakemake workflow system][snakemake]
that covers how to share your worflows. This is not just a matter of uploading code, but a whole
way of thinking about the workflow as a re-usable entity. Tools and approaches that lead to
re-usable code are introduced with practical examples, and the [WorkflowHub.eu][wfh] site
is presented as a publicly-funded and standards-compliant repository for shared workflows.

This lesson is designed to be taught in around in one day, and follows on from the material in
the [Snakemake for Bioinformatics][sforb] episodes.

## Learner Prerequisites

If learners have not worked through the introductory [Snakemake for Bioinformatics][sforb]
course then they should be already familiar with writing pipelines in Snakemake, for example:

- Writing rules and linking them via input/output filenames
- Visualising the DAG generated by Snakemake (`--dag` option)
- Using `--configfile` and config items with Snakemake workflows
- Specifying Conda environments for Snakemake rules

Learners should also follow the set-up instructions for the introductory course, in order to have
the full software environment.

## Notes

[WorkflowHub.eu][wfh] is a [FAIR][fair] registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific
computational workflows. The registry is sponsored by
the [European RI Cluster EOSC-Life][eosclife],
the [European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR][elixir], and multiple EU-wide projects.

This lesson was built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].
