## Accounts on dev.workflowhub.eu

In this part, we are asking learners to interact with a website which we do not directly control.

There are pitfalls here, so we need some prior setup as well as contingencies should anything go
wrong. In particular, the current workflowhub.eu system requires administrator approval to create
a new team and this could take a day or so (or longer if staff in Manchester are absent). A team
must be active in order to upload any content at all.

Assuming this material is ever taught by someone other than Tim Booth, you the tutor will need to
create an account, and get a team approved prior to the course. On the day you may create a second
account so you can follow the same directions as the participants. For my part I have:

Main account (team owner): **tbooth**
Team for use in course: **Submission Tutorial**
Secondary account (to demo as a learner): **tbooth2_2**

For the learners, you probably want to have them register for WorkflowHub the day before this
episode, even though signup is quick and automated. Using GitHub or a password is fine.
They can request membership of the course team and this can very quickly be approved on the
dashboard of the team owner.

In the event that that website becomes unavailable, be there are screenshots below so we can
at least see the process.

## About WorkflowHub.eu

WorkflowHub is a FAIR registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific computational
workflows. The registry is sponsored by multiple EU-wide projects, notably the European RI
Cluster EOSC-Life, and the European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR.

:::::::::::::: callout

While the project is EU-funded, and serves the needs of EU research projects, all users are
welcome. You do not have to be in Europe, or part of any European project team, to make use of it.

::::::::::

From their own guide, these are the reasons why any research project (or team, or facility)
producing workflows should register them in WorkflowHub:

* To give visibility to the workflows used by a project
* To share workflows across a project, within project networks and externally
* To credit and cite the people making workflows, and the networks to which they belong
* To track the new versions of workflows as they are produced, and
* To retain workflows for post-project use by a projectâ€™s members, their networks, and the
  broader scientific community

As an individual user, the ability to search for workflows directly on the site or to obtain a
workflow cited in a paper can be immediately useful. For the purposes of this workshop we will
submit our own sample workflow to show how that side of things works. We'l submit to the
development version of the site, so as not to fill up the main website with test workflows.

## Registering on the WorkflowHub test server

You will need an account on the test server to upload your workflow. Even if you previously
registered on WorkflowHub, register a new account on the development server as the accounts are
completely separate.

1. Visit https://dev.workflowhub.eu
2. Click the Register button
3. Log in with GitHub to create a new account (todo - test this!!!)
3. or... choose a user name and a password. You will need to use a real e-mail address that you
   can access today because there is a verification step.
4. On the next screen, enter your name but leave the other details blank.
5. Verify your account using the e-mail token
6. Finally, log in using your user name and password

:::::::::::: callout

If for any reason some people are unable to create an account, learners may log into the account
owned by the course tutor. Since this is a test server, this is OK.

## Joining a team

In order to use the website, you must be a member of at least one team. One option would be to
make a personal team. We'll not do this today as it requires an administrator approval from the
WorkflowHub maintainers and we don't want to burden them with requests or have to wait for all
the approvals. Instead, all learners can join a team owned by the course tutor. This team name 
is:

**Submission Tutorial**

1. Click on the "Join a Team" option you see after successfully logging in.
1. Find the team as named above and request access.
1. Choose any existing organisation you like, be it your real organisation or not.
1. You can fill in the other things or leave them blank.
1. The tutor will approve all the requests via their own account.

## Submitting our test workflow

[ Insert screenshot here - episodes/fig/wfh_new_workflow.png ]

As we have now stored our workflow in GitHub, and the file layout matches the recommendations,
the easiest option is to use the *Import Git Repository* method.

You will be prompted for the "URL of the git repository". For repositories on GitHub this is
simply the regular URL you would use in your browser, with ".git" on the end. You can also find
this by clicking the "Code" button on the project page within GitHub.

## The Snakemake Workflow Catalogue

https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/

This is another resource where you may find and share Snakemake workflows. It works a little
differently to WorkflowHub, in that.

* This resource is specific to Snakemake workflows
* Workflows are not submitted directly to the catalogue, but are discovered and listed from GitHub
* All the listed workflows are public, as they must be public projects on GitHub to begin with
* There is no option to upload a workflow diagram or any extra documentation
* There is no option to mint a DOI for publication

There is no reason why your workflow should not be in both places.

I'll include making a diagram in here.

Upload to WFH is as per the instructions.

Then we, I think, retrieve the Ro-Crate and commit it back to GIT.

Check how that pans out with the sample workflow.
